Script and config to allow automatic backups of a Nextcloud installation via Restic.  

Greatly inspired by @erikw's [work](https://github.com/erikw/restic-systemd-automatic-backup/blob/master/usr/local/sbin/restic_backup.sh).

Check his repository to find out how to schedule the backups via systemd and how to enable mail delivery among other things..
